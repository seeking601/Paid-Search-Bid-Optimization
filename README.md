# Paid-Search-Bid-Optimization
A travel services firm has a paid search campaign. Among the many keywords in its
campaign, we have data on four keywords, denoted by kw8322228, kw8322392,
kw8322393 and kw8322445. These are generic, non-branded keywords, where the
prospect's query does not indicate that he/she is leaning toward a specific brand. For
each keyword, the firm tried several bid values and recorded the corresponding number
of clicks that it received.

The files are named clicksdata.kw8322228.csv, clicksdata.kw8322392.csv,
clicksdata.kw8322393.csv, clicksdata.kw8322445.csv respectively and be downloaded
here: clicksdata.kw8322228.csv, clicksdata.kw8322392.csv, clicksdata.kw8322393.csv,
clicksdata.kw8322445.csv or all together in this zip file: clicksdata.kw.all.zip.

Part A: Estimate the alpha and beta parameters for each of these four keywords for this
firm. Hand-in: The eight numbers. No additional writeup required. For instructions on
how to estimate alpha and beta from empirical data on bid values and the number of
clicks, as we did in class, click here: Estimating alpha and beta.

Part B1: Assume that the LTV dollar value and the conversion rate values for each of the
keywords for this firm are as shown in the table below. These numbers are available in
an Excel spreadsheet here: hw-kw-ltv-conv.rate-data.xlsx
keyword ltv conv.rate
kw8322228 354 0.3
kw8322392 181 0.32
kw8322393 283 0.3
kw8322445 107 0.3
Assume that you have no budget constraint. Using the alpha, beta parameters from Part
A and the LTV and conversion rate values, estimate the optimal bids for each of the four
keywords. Hand-in: the optimal bid value, the corresponding profit and the
corresponding total expenditure for each of the four keywords. No additional writeup
required.

Part B2: Looking across the four keywords, there is a relationship between LTV and
alpha, a relationship between LTV and beta, and a relationship between LTV and the
optimal bid. What are these relationships? What are the likely reasons for this
relationship? Hand-in: Your identification of the nature of these relationships and your
likely reasons. Please do not spend more than 10 minutes on this part. The relationship
is easy to spot but the explanation is much less obvious. If one cannot propose the
explanation in under 10 minutes, it is unlikely to happen by spending more time on this.
This question is on marketing and consumer psychology rather that statistics. Hint: it has
to do with consumer segments and the fact that these are generic, non-branded
keywords.

Part C: Assume now that you have a budget constraint of $3000 across these four
keywords. Compute the optimal bid amounts and the corresponding expenditures for the
keywords. Which keyword has the least percentage reduction in expenditure as a result
of the constraint? What is the likely reason for this?
